# PennyMac Code Challenge

This is a demonstration of my abilities of coding ability with React for PennyMac.

## Installation
Before running this code yourself, install the necessary packages with
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
By typing the title of a TV show into the search bar, a user will hit the tvmaze api and be shown a list of shows (name/images) that matches their query.


## Considerations
These features were considered, but not added due to time constraint.
- testing/mocking an API call instead of testing with a given array
- screenshot testing
- a pop-up React component that would display a list of episodes on click
- deeper css customization
- a deeper search feature that allows for more filters/sorting
