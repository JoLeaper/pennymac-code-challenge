It follows a group of survivors, led by former police officer Rick Grimes, who travel in search of a safe and secure home. As the world overrun by the dead takes its toll on the survivors, their interpersonal conflicts present a greater danger to their continuing survival than the walkers that roam the country. Over time, the characters are changed by the constant exposure to death and some grow willing to do anything to survive.</p><p>Based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard.</p>",

    summary: "<p>Living in the same universe as <i>The Walking Dead</i>, <b>Fear the Walking Dead </b>is a gritty drama that explores the onset of the undead apocalypse through the lens of a fractured family. Set in a city where people come to escape, shield secrets, and bury their pasts, a mysterious outbreak threatens to disrupt what little stability high school guidance counselor Madison Clark and English teacher Travis Manawa have managed to assemble. The everyday pressure of blending two families while dealing with resentful, escapist, and strung out children takes a back seat when society begins to break down. A forced evolution, a necessary survival of the fittest takes hold, and our dysfunctional family must either reinvent themselves or embrace their darker histories.</p>",

    summary: "<p>It's known as a holy grail in exploration because its sheer length alone contributes to its timeless mystery. The Nile, the planet's longest river, is a life source to six African countries (Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Republic of Sudan and Egypt) - some of whose names currently are synonymous with danger and conflict. The Nile also is known as the cradle of civilization; the first cities known to man were developed on its storied shores. It snakes its way through a region that's full of duality: it's both peaceful and dangerous; it is both a source of life and cause of death; it's remote and urban; and it's the epicenter for a diverse mix of religions and cultures, both modern and primitive. Now, dauntless explorer and former British Army paratrooper Levison Wood is <b>Walking the Nile</b> - from source to sea - to uncover its many perplexities and to be the first person ever to endure something of extraordinary magnitude.</p>",
